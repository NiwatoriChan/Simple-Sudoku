# Simple-Sudoku

A classic Sudoku puzzle game built with a modern frontend stack. This project utilizes Vue.js for its reactive component-based architecture and Tailwind CSS for a utility-first approach to styling, resulting in a responsive and visually clean user interface.

This repository serves as a demonstration of building an interactive web application with these technologies. Feel free to explore the code, try out the game, or contribute!
